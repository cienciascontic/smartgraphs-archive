In fact, there is a <em>mathematical relationship</em> between chirp rate and temperature. If you know this relationship and have a watch or a timer to count the number of cricket chirps per minute, you can calculate the temperature.</p>\r\n<p>In this activity, you will think about the relationship between crickets chirping and temperature.&nbsp; To do this, you'll use a graph to find trends in data and create a mathematical relationship.&nbsp; With this relationship you'll estimate some <em>new</em> data points without any calculating using a process known as <strong><em>interpolation</em></strong>. At the end, you'll also get some practice calculating temperatures and chirp rates from this newfound relationship.</p>",

  This object contains information about the browser environment SproutCore is

    - browser.device                  ex. SC.DEVICE.ipad
    - browser.name                    ex. SC.BROWSER.chrome
    - browser.version                 ex. '16.0.2.34'
    - browser.os                      ex. SC.OS.mac
    - browser.osVersion               ex. '10.6'
    - browser.engine                  ex. SC.ENGINE.webkit
    - browser.engineVersion           ex. '533.29'

  Note: User agent sniffing does not provide guaranteed results and spoofing may
  affect the accuracy.  Therefore, as a general rule, it is much better
  to rely on the browser's verified capabilities in SC.platform.

  Based on the unit test samples, the most stable browser properties appear to
  be `engine` and `engineVersion`.
